# Conway's Game of Life

A Kotlin version of the infamous cellular game!

This program is the standard game of life with some extra features. Cells can be added by clicking on a specific location on the play field. Also, you can generate a random game which places cells randomly on the play field. There is also a wide variety of premade patterns.
