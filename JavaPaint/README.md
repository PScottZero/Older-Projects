# JavaPaint Version 1.00

Java Paint is designed to be a simple to use painting program. It has a few simple tool that allow for users to draw shapes like rectangles, ovals, and triangle. It also features the ability to open and save images.

<br>
<i><b>Configuration:</b></i>

The first thing that should be done is the .jar file of the program should be put in a folder. When the program is run for the first time, a file is generated named "config.txt". In this file, you have the ability to change the background image of the program, and the size of the paint canvas. The config.txt file does not have to be edited for the program to run. It is used only to customize the application. When the text file is opened, two parameters are printed:

Size: 800 600

Background:

The "Size" parameter is for the size of the canvas. The default width and height is 800 and 600 respectively. Changes these two values will result in the canvas size being changed. The "Background" parameter is for choosing a custom background image for the application. When choosing an image, make sure it is in the same folder as the program. To choose the image, simply time both its name and extension into the parameter. For both the size and background parameter, make sure all data is separated by spaces. Here is an example of what an edited config.txt file should look like (mind the spaces):

Size: 1000 1000

Background: bkg.png

When the application is opened, there are two main areas that are displayed. The area to the left is the toolbar. The toolbar has numerous tools used to paint on the canvas, which is the area to the right. The following are all of the tools on the toolbar in order:
